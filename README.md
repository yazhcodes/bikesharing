<h2>OVERVIEW:</h2>
<p>The purpose of this analysis is to figure out how the bike sharing business actually works in NYC. Using this knowledge, we are to make a proposal of how a similar program might run in Des Moine, Iowa.</p>

        <h3>Manhattan Loves Bikes!</h3>
        <p>All of the frequently used Starting and Ending Stations seem to be popping out from Manhattan Borough. Owing to lesser availability and affordability of parking space in Manhattan, it is safe to assume that Manhattanites like taking advantage of the New York City's rental bike service much more than the fellow New Yorkers.

        <h3>Short Rides are popular!</h3>
        <p> The most common trip duration is 5 minutes. It says a lot about the purpose of these rides which could be a quick commute to school or work, meaning the riders reside at a distance from school/work that could be too long to walk by but it could be perfect for a bike ride without tiring themselves out during transit.

        <h3>Peak and Off-Peak Hours</h3>
        <p>Rush hours have been recorded on weekdays at 8AM and 5-6PM. Wednesday evenings are an exception to this pattern and are realtively less busy with a dip in trip count. But it doubles up on Thursday evenings proving to be the busiest time of the week.</p>

        <h3>Time to Show the Bikes some Love</h3>
        <p>Despite the frequent rides across New York, some bikes are being over utiilized than others, which have been picked up by this chart. It's evident that these bikes are screaming for a tune-up as soon as possible without hurting the riders' routines.</p>

<h2>SUMMARY:</h2>
<h3>Suggestions for Des Moines Bike Sharing Program:</h3>
<p>After analyzing the NYC Bike Sharing Data in depth, here are the conclusions/suggestions to kickstart a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We have witnessed the success of NYC-BS in Manhattan out of all the other boroughs, so it is safe to launch the Bike Sharing program at <strong>Downtown Des Moines</strong> before expanding to the rest of the Des Moines city.</li>
    <li>It is important to <strong>strategically place bike stations</strong> near major commercial/industrial spaces and also near major intersections leading to residential spaces. This allows the riders to keep their trips short (not tiring) during their daily commute and will keep them coming back on a routine basis.</li>
    <li>8AM and 5-6PM on weekdays are the <strong>peak hours</strong> to expect so enough bikes have to be stocked at stations before this time. Any <strong>maintainence activity</strong> can be scheduled during off-peak hours.</li>
    <li>We know we will be attracting more <strong>male riders</strong> than females. While it is essential to focus on the potentially easy customers in the beginning, it is also crucial to offer subsidized services to attract more <strong>female riders</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Analysis & Visualizations:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A <strong>Des Moines map layer</strong> with prominent industrial, commercial or educational spaces and major residential intersections can be used to determine suitable location of bike stations.</li>
    <li>Geographical data about <strong>recreational spaces</strong> can be gathered and special weekend bike stations could be set up near these locations. The bikes from industrial spaces could be <strong>rotated</strong> with these stations during weekends and weekdays.</li>
</ul>
